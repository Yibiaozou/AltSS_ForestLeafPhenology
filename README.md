# AltSS_ForestLeafPhenology

This repository contains the code used for the analysis in the paper "Evidence for alternative stable states in leaf phenology across global forests".
The repository is organized as follows: 
1) The folder 'Global_Analysis' contains code for data-preprocess, bimodality testing, mapping and determinant analysis etc. using the GFBi global forest inventory data.
2) The folder 'Continental_Analysis' contains code for data-preprocess, bimodality testing, demographic ananlysis etc. in both continental US (FIA) and Europe (FunDivEUROPE). 
3) The folder 'Figures_Making' contains code for visualizing all the analysis results shown in the paper.
